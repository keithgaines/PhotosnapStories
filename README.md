# PhotoSnap - React and RedwoodJS Rebuild
Welcome to the higher level rebuild of PhotoSnap! In this project, I have taken the original version I built (https://github.com/keithgaines/photosnap) and rebuilt it using modern technologies like React, RedwoodJS, and additional components. The aim was to create a more robust and feature-rich front end utilizing the power of React and TypeScript, while keeping the design constraints of the original challnge.

## Introduction

This challenge was originally a Front End Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenge, but I built this version as a full stack web app hosted on Vercel. 

## Features

The rebuild of PhotoSnap includes several new features and improvements over the original version. Some of the key features are:

- **React and TypeScript**: The entire front end is built using React and TypeScript, enabling a more structured and type-safe development experience.
- **RedwoodJS**: The project utilizes RedwoodJS, a full-stack JavaScript framework built on React and GraphQL, providing a powerful foundation for building scalable and maintainable applications.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring seamless access and optimal viewing across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Careful consideration has been given to optimize the performance of the application, ensuring fast load times and smooth interactions.

## Technologies Used

The rebuild of PhotoSnap leverages a variety of technologies to deliver a powerful and engaging experience. The key technologies used in this project are:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a flexible and efficient way to create interactive components.
- **RedwoodJS**: A full-stack JavaScript framework built on React and GraphQL, simplifying the development of scalable and robust applications.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript, adding static types to enable enhanced code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs, enabling efficient data fetching and providing a strongly-typed schema for better developer experience.
- **CSS Modules**: A CSS approach that scopes styles to individual components, reducing conflicts and improving maintainability.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizing CSS media queries and responsive techniques to ensure optimal viewing across different devices and screen sizes.
